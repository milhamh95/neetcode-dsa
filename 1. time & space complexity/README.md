# Time & Space Complexity

## Time complexity

- measurement total amount of time taken by algorithm to run according to input size

## Space complexity

- measurement total amount of memory algorithm / operations needed to run according to input size

## Big O Notation

- describes the complexity of your code using algebraic terms
- refer to very large value of n (input)
- ex

```
time = 5 * n ^ 2 + 3 * n + 20

When value of n is very large b * n + c become irrelevant

Ex: n = 1000

time = 5 * (1000 ^ 2) + 3 * 1000 + 20
time = 5000000 + 3020

3020 -> minor
5000000 -> very major
```
